# PIR-Motion-Sensor
This project uses an Arduino Uno and a PIR motion sensor to detect movement. When motion is detected, the sensor signals the Arduino to activate an LED as an alert. This basic system demonstrates motion detection and can be expanded with a buzzer or additional sensors for security applications.
